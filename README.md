# llama-cpp-java-bindings

This is a WIP that will provide bindings for using llama.cpp with Java

The intention is to provide a basic function for function Java interface with llama.h. Once these fundamental bindings are done, fluent Java APIs will be produced for easy interaction with llama.cpp.

Currently, the testing is being done in [jllama-tests](https://github.com/crimsonmagick/jllama-tests)
